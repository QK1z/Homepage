# Homepage
My first homepage
Below is my first website. Beginnings can be difficult. I took the first steps. Does it look good? Judge for yourself. Over time, my homepage will be modified and improved. We'll see what comes of it :)
In this project I used BEM technology, I made my first steps with CSS and small steps with Java Script.
